Assignment 4: feature engineering and multinomial outcomes. 

## Part 1: Feature Engineering

**Instructions:**  
Using the hsls dataset complete the following tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Change the sector variable to have three types: for-profit, not-for-profit, and public
   - Identify and handle missing values.

2. **Feature Creation**  
   - Create interaction terms between at least two variables.
   - Engineer at least two new features that could improve model performance.

4. **Feature Selection**  
   - Use correlation analysis to remove redundant features.
   - Use our standard set of steps to structure and prep the data for analysis using 
   regularization.
 
## Part 2: Elastic Net for Multinomial Outcomes

**Instructions:**  
Using the three part outcome above from hsls:

1. **Model Setup**  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Define a multinomial logistic regression model with an **elastic net** penalty.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Use cross-validation to tune the **alpha** and **lambda** parameters.
   - Identify the optimal values for these hyperparameters.

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Report accuracy, and roc-auc
 
4. **Comparing Models**  
   - Compare the elastic net multinomial model to a baseline model (proportions only)
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using elastic net regularization.
