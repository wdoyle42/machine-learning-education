# Homework Assignment: Predicting Course Withdrawal Using Open University Data

## Objective:
In this assignment, you will explore the Open University dataset to predict whether a student will withdraw from a course. 

### Step 1: Data Preparation
1. Load the Open University dataset.  
2. Familiarize yourself with the key variables, focusing on the target variable (`Withdrawn`) and possible predictors (e.g., `age`, `num_of_prev_attempts`, `final_result`).

### Step 2: Bivariate Analysis
1. Select one predictor that you believe may be associated with withdrawal.
2. Create a bivariate table or graphical display (e.g., bar plot, contingency table) showing the relationship between the predictor and withdrawal status.
3. Summarize what this display tells you about the potential relationship.

### Step 3: Build a Classification Tree
1. Use a classification tree to predict course withdrawal based on a small number of selected predictors.
2. Visualize a the tree and describe how it splits the data.
3. Build a larger model using the full dataset. 
4. Tune the hyperparameters of the classification tree and use the result to fit a final model. 
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix).

### Step 4: Build a Random Forest Model
1. Build and tune the mtry and depth parameters of a random forest. Set the number of trees to 100. 
2. Select the best fit and test it against the testing dataset. 
3. Evaluate the random forest's performance using the same metrics as in Step 3.
4. Discuss how random forests differ from single decision trees. (2-3 sentences)

### Step 5: Model Comparison
1. Compare the performance metrics of the classification tree and the random forest.
2. Discuss which model performs better and why.
3. Reflect on situations in which a classification tree might be preferred over a random forest or vice versa (1-2 sentences).
