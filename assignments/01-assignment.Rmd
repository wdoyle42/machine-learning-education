### Assignment: Analyzing and Modeling Postsecondary Credits

In this assignment we'll be pushing further out into the future. I want you to predict the number of postsecondary credits someone earned by 2018, based on the individual's entering characteristics as a ninth grader in 2009. 

This assignment will assess your ability to:
- Present and analyze a dependent variable.
- Understand and apply regularization techniques.
- Effectively communicate results through coding and visualization.

1. **Exploring the Dependent Variable**
   - Load the dataset and clean the data. The `hsls_extract2.csv` dataset is on the brightspace page, under datasets.  Summarize `x5postern` using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation). Visualize its distribution using a histogram and a density plot. (hint: summarize, geom_histogram). 

2. **Categorical Variable Analysis**
   - Identify any categorical independent variables in the dataset. Create a bar plot to explore the mean values of `x5postern` across different levels of one selected categorical variable. (hint: group_by, summarize, geom_col)

3. **Continuous Variable Analysis**
   - Select one continuous independent variable. Create a scatterplot with `x5postern` on the y-axis and the selected independent variable on the x-axis. Add a trendline to visualize the relationship. (hint: `geom_point`)

4. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Identify missing values for `x5postern` and other variables. Make sure to handle missing data! Remember that for most variables, all negative values indicate missing data. This is true for `x5postern.`


5. **Linear Regression Model**
   - Fit a standard linear regression model to predict `x5postern` using all available predictors. Report the coefficients, \( R^2 \), and RMSE of the model. Interpret the top three predictors based on their coefficients.

6. **Feature Engineering**
   - Modify the dataset by creating at least one new feature (e.g., an interaction term or a transformed variable (hint: `step_log`, `step_poly`)). Refit the linear regression model with this new feature. Compare the RMSE and \( R^2 \) values with the previous model.

7. **Lasso Regression Setup**
   - Set up a Lasso regression model using `tidymodels`. Use a range of penalties to evaluate how the model simplifies variable selection. Provide a summary of the variables retained at different penalty levels.

8. **Lasso Regression Evaluation**
   - Identify the penalty value among those you worked with that resulted in the lowest rmse. 

9. **Visualizing Regularization**
    - Create two plots:
      - RMSE versus penalty values (on a logarithmic scale).
      - Coefficient estimates versus penalty values for the top two predictors. 
    - Interpret these plots and discuss how the penalty affects model performance and variable selection.



### Submission Instructions:
- Include all code in an organized RMarkdown or similar document.
- Provide brief interpretations for each step, focusing on how the results contribute to understanding `x5postern`.
