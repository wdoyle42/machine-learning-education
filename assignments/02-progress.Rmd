For this progress report I want you to begin describing patterns in your dependent variable.

1. Univariate analysis: provide appropriate measures of central tendency and variability for your dependent variable. If your dv is continuous, provide graphics showing the distribution of your variable.
2. Bivariate analysis: provide the conditional mean of your dependent variable as function of at least three and no more than five of your independent variables. Provide the results in a table or graphic. Remember to use the group_by--> summarize approach, where group_by is based on a categorical or discretized independent variable.
