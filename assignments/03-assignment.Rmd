## Assignment 3: Predicting Four-Year vs. Two-Year College Attendance Using Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization

In this assignment, you will analyze a dataset to model the probability of attending a four-year institution versus a two-year institution as a function of parental education.
You will use logistic regression with elastic net regularization, perform Monte Carlo cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC.

### 1. Data Preparation

Load the dataset and clean the data as necessary.

Create a binary outcome variable with two levels:

"Attend 4-Year" for students attending a four-year institution.
"Attend 2-Year" for students attending a two-year institution or other postsecondary pathways.

Drop missing values where necessary.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Create a visualization showing the probability of attending a four-year institution as a function of parental education.

### 3. Model Building Using Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization

Define the logistic regression model with elastic net regularization.

Preprocess the data using a recipe-based workflow, ensuring:

-   All categorical predictors are converted to dummy variables.
-   Features are normalized where necessary.
-   Near-zero variance features are removed.

### 4. Model Tuning via Monte Carlo Cross-Validation

Perform Monte Carlo cross-validation (e.g., 25 repetitions).
Tune both penalty (λ) and mixture (α) parameters to optimize the model. Utilize one of the two
tuning processes that we discussed-- simulated annealing or Bayesian optimization. 
Select the best hyperparameters based on ROC AUC. Visualize how accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC vary across regularization values.

### 5. Final Model Fitting

Fit the final logistic regression model using the best hyperparameters on the full training dataset.

### 6. Model Evaluation on the Testing Dataset

Generate predictions on the test set.
Report the following metrics:

Accuracy – The proportion of correct classifications.
Sensitivity – The proportion of actual four-year attendees correctly classified.
Specificity – The proportion of actual two-year attendees correctly classified.
ROC AUC – A measure of overall classification performance.

For each metric, provide a one- or two-sentence interpretation of what it means in the context of predicting four-year college attendance.
