## Assignment 3: Predicting Four-Year vs. Two-Year College Attendance Using Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization

In this assignment, you will analyze a dataset to model the probability of attending a four-year institution versus a two-year institution as a function of parental education. You will use logistic regression with elastic net regularization, perform Monte Carlo cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC.

Instructions

### 1. Data Preparation

Load the dataset and clean the data as necessary.

Create a binary outcome variable with two levels:

"Attend 4-Year" for students attending a four-year institution.
"Attend 2-Year" for students attending a two-year institution or other postsecondary pathways.

Drop missing values where necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Create a visualization showing the probability of attending a four-year institution as a function of parental education.

3. Model Building Using Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization

Define the logistic regression model with elastic net regularization.

Preprocess the data using a recipe-based workflow, ensuring:

- All categorical predictors are converted to dummy variables.
- Features are normalized where necessary.
- Near-zero variance features are removed.

4. Model Tuning via Monte Carlo Cross-Validation

Perform Monte Carlo cross-validation (e.g., 25 repetitions).
Tune both penalty (λ) and mixture (α) parameters to optimize the model.
Select the best hyperparameters based on ROC AUC.
Visualize how accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC vary across regularization values.

5. Final Model Fitting
Fit the final logistic regression model using the best hyperparameters on the full training dataset.

6. Model Evaluation on the Testing Dataset

Generate predictions on the test set.
Report the following metrics:

Accuracy – The proportion of correct classifications.
Sensitivity – The proportion of actual four-year attendees correctly classified.
Specificity – The proportion of actual two-year attendees correctly classified.
ROC AUC – A measure of overall classification performance.

For each metric, provide a one- or two-sentence interpretation of what it means in the context of predicting four-year college attendance.
