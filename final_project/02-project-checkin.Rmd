# Check-in 2: Outcome summary as a function of predictors (EDA)

## Goal
Describe your **outcome (dependent variable)** and show how it varies with several **independent variables** using both **tabular and graphical** analysis. Use techniques like **conditional means**, **correlations**, and **simple regression** to quantify relationships.

## What to do

### 1) Describe the outcome variable
- State the outcome variable name and type (continuous / binary / multiclass / count / etc.).
- Report basic distribution facts:
  - Missingness (% missing)
  - If continuous: mean, SD, median, IQR, min/max (or sensible bounds), histogram/density
  - If binary/multiclass: class proportions, bar chart

### 2) Choose several predictors to examine
- Select **at least 4–6 independent variables** you think are plausibly related to the outcome.
- Briefly justify why each is relevant (1 sentence each is enough).

### 3) Tabular analysis: conditional summaries
Use tables to summarize the outcome **conditional on predictor values**.
- For **categorical predictors**:
  - Table of **mean outcome by category** (or % outcome=1 for binary outcomes), plus **N** per group
  - Optionally include standard errors or confidence intervals if you know how
- For **continuous predictors**:
  - Create **binned summaries** (e.g., quintiles/deciles) and report mean outcome by bin
  - Include N per bin

### 4) Graphical analysis
Include **at least 3–5 figures** that directly answer “how does Y change with X?”
Examples:
- Box/violin plots of outcome by categorical predictor
- Scatterplots (with smoothing line) for outcome vs continuous predictor
- Binned means plot (mean outcome by predictor bin)
- If outcome is binary: plots of predicted probability from a simple logistic regression vs X

### 5) Quantify relationships
Use at least **two** of the following (more is fine):
- **Correlation matrix** (for continuous predictors and continuous outcome)
- **Simple regressions** (outcome on one predictor at a time) to get an interpretable slope
- **Multiple regression** (outcome on several predictors) as a descriptive model (not a final ML model)

Be explicit about what each statistic is telling you, and avoid causal language.

### 6) Short written interpretation
Write ~300–600 words summarizing:
- What stands out about the outcome distribution
- Which predictors appear most related to the outcome (and in what direction)
- Any surprises, data issues, or limitations (missingness, outliers, imbalance)

## Submission requirements
Submit a short document with:
1. Outcome description + distribution summary
2. List of selected predictors + brief justification
3. **At least 2 tables** of conditional summaries
4. **At least 3–5 plots**
5. **At least 2 quantitative relationship summaries** (correlation/regression/etc.)
6. A short narrative interpretation

## Common problems to avoid
- Only describing the dataset, not the relationship between outcome and predictors
- Showing plots without labeling axes/units or without interpretation
- Using one predictor only (pick several)
- Treating correlation as causation
