# Machine Learning in Education

# LPO 7500

# Spring 2025

## Will Doyle


Machine learning constitutes a different field from statistics given its focus on 
out-of-sample prediction as opposed to statistics' emphasis on 
inference and estimation. While many of the same algorithms are used,
the purpose of the two are quite distinct. In education, machine learning
supports a variety of predictive tasks, but education researchers are 
rarely trained in the development of machine learning models. 

This course will introduce the learner to machine learning in education settings
The focus will be pragmatic, with an emphasis on how various models
are tuned in order to best provide out-of-sample predictions with the lowest
loss rates. Learners will know how to train and deploy some widely-used models
after taking the course. 

## Evaluation

*Problem Sets* 

There will be 10 problem sets, each of which will be worth 10 points. Assignments 
will constitute 50% of the final grade. 

*Semester-Long Assignment*

Students will create a deployable model trained on an existing dataset. 
Students will write a manuscript describing their process and the nature of the model
(predictive results and variable importance, as appropriate).This manuscript should be 
a good first draft for a manuscript suitable for publication.  Students will also create a 
github repository containing the code to create the model and the deployable model. Students may work either 
alone or in a group of two on this assignment.

There will be four check-in assignments, a draft of the final paper, and the paper. These will be
referred to as "progress reports" draft and final version. Combined these will constitute 50% of the final grade, the final paper will be 50% of this portion, and each
check-in and the draft will be 10%. 

## Expectations

Attendance: you have to show up. If you can't make it, please let me know. 

Honor code: assignments are to be completed individually, group assignments only by members of the group. Generative AI
may be used as a learning tool, but copying and pasting the results of generative AI and describing it as your own work
is a clear violation of the honor code. 

Technology: please do not use your mobile device at any time except for two-factor authentication. Do not use your laptop for
anything other than class purposes. Using technology for other purposes distracts your classmates, and for this reason if 
you make a habit of doing so I'll ask you to leave class for the day.

## Health and Safety
Our mutual commitment to health and safety is vital. Toward that end, all 
students are expected to adhere to Vanderbilt health and safety protocols. 
Guidance may be updated throughout the semester.

## Classroom Accommodations
Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity for students with disabilities. 
If you need course accommodations due to a disability, please contact VU 
Student Access Services to initiate the process. After SAS has notified me of 
relevant accommodations, we will discuss how these accommodations may best 
be approached in this class, and I will facilitate the accommodations.

## Mental Health & Wellness
If you are experiencing undue stress that may be interfering with your ability 
to perform academically, Vanderbilt’s Student Care Network offers a range of 
support services. The Office of Student Care Coordination (OSCC) is the central
and first point of contact to help you navigate and connect to appropriate 
resources. You can schedule an appointment with the OSCC at 
https://www.vanderbilt.edu/carecoordination/ or call 615-343-WELL. 
You can find a calendar of services at 
https://www.vanderbilt.edu/studentcarenetwork/satellite-services/.
If you or someone you know needs to speak with a professional counselor
immediately, the University Counseling Center offers Urgent Care Counseling. 
Students should call the UCC at (615) 322-2571 during office hours to speak
with an urgent care clinician. You can also reach an on-call counselor after
hours or on the weekends by calling (615) 322-2571 and pressing option 2 at any
time. You can find additional information at https://www.vanderbilt.edu//ucc/.

## Mandatory Reporter Obligations

All University faculty and administrators are mandatory reporters. 
What this means is that all faculty and administrators must report allegations
of sexual misconduct and intimate partner violence to the Title IX Coordinator.
In addition, all faculty and administrators are obligated to report any 
allegations of discrimination. I am willing to discuss with you such incidents
but can only do so in the context of us both understanding my reporting
obligations. If you want to talk with someone in confidence, officials in 
the Student Health Center, the University Counseling Center, and the Office 
of the Chaplain and Religious Life (when acting as clergy) can maintain
confidentiality. In addition, officials in the Project Safe Center have
limited confidentiality, in that they must report the incidents but can do so 
without providing identifying information. The Project Safe Center serves 
as the central resource for those impacted by sexual misconduct and 
intimate partner violence and can assist with navigating all facets of the 
University’s resource and support network and other processes.

## Names and Pronouns

If you would like to use a different name or pronouns than those 
provided through YES, please let the instructor know at any time prior to or
during the semester. Information is available through the LGBTQI Life 
offices about how to change either or both of these in YES.
