## Data Set Size

Small: <2,000 cases

Medium 2k-10k

Else: >10k

Small datasets:

---Relatively few features: <50 

Classification and Regression Tree

Glmnet

---Everything else

Glmnet

Medium Datasets

Small Features, <50

Class and Regress Tree

Random Forests

Large Features, >50

Glmnet, (binary outcome =SVM)

Large Datasets

Outcome: Binary, Multinomial, Continuous

Binary: SVM (features don't separate cleanly)
        XGboost
        
Multinomial: MLP/Neural Net (large number (>10) classes)
             Xgboost( large number of cases=very data hungry)
             Glmnet/multionmial logit

Continuous: Glmnet, Xgboost 

Moderate/Severe missing data problem= Random Forests
