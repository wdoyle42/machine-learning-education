## Feature Engineering

Today we'll be reviewing the kind of amazing set of functions available for feature engineering in tidymodels. We'll focus on a few subsets:

- Transformations
- Categorical/binary variables
- Imputation
- Interactions and Expansions

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)
```


## Transformations


Transformations refer to any kind of numeric transformation. The key here is linear versus non-linear transforms. Linear transforms just aid in interpretability or ensure identical scales for regularizations. Non-linear transforms are a modeling choice-- they make a fundamental change in how the model works. 


```{r}
hs<-read_csv("hsls_extract.csv")%>%clean_names()
```

```{r}

```
