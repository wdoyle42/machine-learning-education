### Final Project Check-In 1: Identifying Your Topic, Outcome, and Dataset

**Purpose**:  
The purpose of this first check-in is to lay the foundation for your final project by selecting a topic area, defining an outcome to predict, and identifying the dataset you will use. This initial step ensures that you have a clear direction and are working with appropriate data to build a deployable machine learning model.

#### **Assignment Instructions**
For this check-in, you will:
1. **Choose a General Topic Area**  
   Identify the general area of interest for your project. This can be broad, such as:
   - Education (e.g., student performance, reading comprehension)
   - Health (e.g., patient readmissions, disease diagnosis)
   - Economics (e.g., income prediction, unemployment trends)
   - Environment (e.g., energy consumption, air quality)
   - Any other domain that is meaningful to you.

2. **Define an Outcome Variable**  
   Select the specific outcome you aim to predict. Examples include:
   - Second-grade reading comprehension scores (continuous variable)
   - Postsecondary credits earned one year after enrollment (continuous variable)
   - Image recognition ()
   - The likelihood of a student being reclassified from english learner status (binary categorical variable)

   Provide a brief explanation of why this outcome is meaningful and relevant to your chosen topic area.

3. **Identify a Dataset**  
   Find a real-world dataset that you will use for your project. The dataset should be:
   - Publicly available or accessible to you.
   - Contain sufficient data to build a predictive model.
   - Include features (independent variables) that you believe are relevant for predicting your outcome variable.

   For this section, provide:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its size (e.g., number of rows and columns), data sources, and any relevant context.
   - A link or reference to where the dataset can be accessed.

#### **Submission Requirements**
Your submission should include the following:
1. **General Topic Area**: One to two sentences describing the broad domain of your project.
2. **Outcome Variable**: One paragraph describing your chosen outcome, why it matters, and how it aligns with your topic area.
3. **Dataset**:
   - Name and description of the dataset.
   - Source of the dataset (e.g., URL or organization).
   - Brief explanation of why you believe this dataset is appropriate for your project.
