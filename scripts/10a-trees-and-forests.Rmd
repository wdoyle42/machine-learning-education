## Instructions:
### Step 1: Data Preparation

Load the Open University dataset, focusing only on students who passed the course (i.e., remove any students who withdrew or failed).


### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform an initial exploratory analysis:

Create bivariate displays (e.g., bar chart or table) to examine the relationship between a predictor and the distinction status.

Summarize your findings and hypothesize which factors may be the most important.

Step 3: Build a Classification Tree

Build a simple (4-5 variable) classification tree to predict distinction status.

Visualize the tree and interpret how it splits the data.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Build out a fully-specified decision tree and tune the hyperparameters. 

Evaluate your decision tree against the testing data and provide the roc_auc.


Step 4: Build a Random Forest Model

Build a random forest using the full dataset

Build aa randome forest model and tune the hyperparameters `mtry` and `min_n`  using cross-validation. Use a tree depth of just 25 trees for now. 

Identify the most important features (predictors) in the random forest.


## Step 5: Model Comparison and Interpretation

Compare the performance of the classification tree and the random forest.

Discuss which model is more effective for predicting distinction status and why.

Reflect on the limitations of your analysis and suggest ways to improve it.
