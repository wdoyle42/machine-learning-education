**Case Study: Automated Grading and Feedback for Writing Assignments**

**Background and Problem of Practice:**
A state-wide virtual school is piloting an AI-assisted grading system to provide real-time feedback on student essays in English and social studies courses. The goal is to supplement teacher grading by identifying common writing errors, evaluating essay structure, and offering personalized feedback.

The system aims to help students improve their writing skills by providing instant, constructive feedback while allowing teachers to focus on higher-level writing instruction and mentoring. The school seeks to implement the system in a way that balances efficiency with fairness and accuracy.

**Dependent Variable(s) of Interest:**
1. **Primary Outcome:** Quality of student writing (e.g., graded rubric score, pass/fail, improvement in revision quality).
2. **Secondary Outcome:** Student engagement with feedback and improvements across multiple drafts.

**Decision-Making Context:**
The predictive analysis will help the virtual school:
- Provide faster, data-driven feedback to students.
- Reduce grading workload for teachers while maintaining instructional quality.
- Identify common writing challenges at the class and school level.
- Improve student writing outcomes through targeted recommendations.
- Ensure fairness and equity in grading, avoiding biases in AI assessments.

**Student Task:**
In response to this case, your group should develop a predictive modeling approach that includes:

1. **Operationalizing the Dependent Variable(s):**
   - How should writing quality be measured (e.g., rubric-based scoring, automated text analysis)?
   - How can student improvement be quantified across multiple drafts?
   
2. **Identifying Features for Prediction:**
   - What independent variables should be included? Consider the following potential predictors:
     - Sentence complexity and coherence
     - Grammar and spelling accuracy
     - Argument structure and use of supporting evidence
     - Writing style and vocabulary richness
     - Plagiarism detection indicators
     - Length and completeness of the response
     - Student revision history and engagement with feedback

3. **Developing a Predictive Strategy:**
   - How should automated grading be balanced with human oversight?
   - How can the system differentiate between content-related and mechanical errors?
   - How can fairness and bias mitigation be addressed in AI-generated grading?

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation:**
   - How should the model be trained and validated to ensure accuracy?
   - What evaluation metrics should be used to compare AI grading with teacher grading?
   - How can adaptive learning strategies be incorporated for personalized feedback?

5. **Deployment and Recommendations for Practice:**
   - How should the grading system be integrated into the virtual schoolâ€™s learning platform?
   - What measures should be taken to ensure transparency and explainability in AI-generated feedback?
   - How should teachers be trained to use AI-generated insights effectively?
   - How can students be encouraged to engage with feedback for meaningful writing improvement?

**Communicating Results with Decision-Makers:**
- How should predictive insights be framed for teachers, students, and administrators?
- What visualizations (e.g., writing improvement dashboards, trend reports) can best illustrate key findings?
- How should potential biases and limitations in AI grading be communicated?
- What strategies can be used to gain trust and acceptance from educators and students?
- How can feedback from human graders be integrated to improve the model over time?

**Final Deliverable:**
Your group will present a structured response, detailing the selected approach for each of the five components above. Provide a rationale for your choices and offer recommendations on how the virtual school should interpret and act on the results to support effective and equitable writing instruction.
